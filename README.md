# HCF-GCD_Calculator
A simple program to calculate Highest Common Factor (HCf) of any two numbers.
As we know that, HCF is a largest number which can divide both two given numbers.
So, to find HCF we have simple strategy, first we will find smallest number from the given two numbers.
We will use 'for loop' from 1 till the smallest number. And also the 'i' in loop will get updated while the 'for loop' runs.
If the any greatest number till smallest given number gets divided by the both given numbers, then that number will be HCF.
